## About

This is the Youtube Channel and Video Analytics Scraper project. It is written in **jupyter notebook** and uses the [**youtube-channel-api**] and [**youtube-video-api**] (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list) module to gain access to the **channel statistics** (for ex: views, subscribers etc).<p>
  
<p> Given a YouTube video URL the client will request all **video statistics** (for ex: likes, comments etc) for that video from the API. The results are displayed as nicely formatted JSON and CSV and can also be downloaded in those formats.

The results and insights scraped include the following information:

- Who has the highest number of subcribers?
- Who's got the most views ?
- Who uploaded the highest number of videos?
- Top 10 Videos of a channel
- Videos released per month by a channel
